# The producer-consumer problem: A solution using synchronized methods #

## About
This project implements a solution to the well-known [producer-consumer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Producer–consumer_problem) problem using synchronized methods. In the Java programming language, synchronized methods implement the concept of monitors to ensure the mutual exclusion of concurrent threads when executing methods. These threads are also condition-synchronized; they can be suspended or notified for resumption of execution under certain conditions.

## The producer-consumer problem
The producer-consumer problem refers to a data area (a bounded buffer) shared by two types of processes, producers and consumers. Producers generate and insert new elements into the shared buffer, while consumers remove and consume elements from it. The following constraints must also be satisfied:

* Only one operation (insertion or removal of elements into/from the buffer) can be performed at a time
* Producers cannot insert new elements when the buffer is full: they must be suspended
* Consumers cannot remove elements when the buffer is empty: they must be suspended
* Elements must be removed in the same order in which they were inserted

This solution to the problem consists of implementing the insertion and removal operations as synchronized methods, thereby ensuring their execution under mutual exclusion. While the current size of the buffer equals the established capacity, producer threads should be suspended. If it is possible to add a new element to the buffer, then a consumer thread that has been suspended should be notified to resume execution. On the other hand, while the current size of the buffer is equal to zero, consumer threads should be suspended. If it is possible to remove an element from the buffer, then a producer thread that has been suspended should be notified to resume execution.
